# Waste To Taste üçΩ
Bangkit Capstone Project, 
This project will consist of 3 important parts, which are Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, and Mobile apps.

## About
As per the Food Waste Index Report 2024 by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Indonesia ranks the highest in household food waste in Southeast Asia, amounting to 14.73 million tons per year. In response, we have developed an application aimed at reducing household food waste by maximizing the utilization of leftover ingredients. 

This application targets individuals with excess but still edible food ingredients, who struggle to find suitable recipes for them. Its key feature is a recipe search function tailored to users' available ingredients. The creation of this application is crucial as it simplifies the process for users to repurpose leftover food into new meals.
